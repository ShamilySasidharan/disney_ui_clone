# Authentication
- using the firebase authentications
- follow the steps add the sdk in utils > firebase.js file
- VERY IMPORTANT TO WRITE THE PUBLIC FOLDER OF THE FIREBASE AS "build"
- Basically telling the firebase to use this folder for the deployment
- Done the signup sign in and signout  authentication
- used onAuthStateChanged for the track the change in the state of the authentication, whenever the user signin,signup or signout this function is  called and is always better to write in one place(app.js)
- updated the store with the user name and photoURL and dispatch an action to store in redux store
- updated the signout feature signout btn show only when the 


# Redux store
User
- created the appStore
- created the userSlice
- provide to the appStore
- provide to the whole store, in app.js we are already using the dispatch function so we are calling the dispatch before providing to the app as a result we need to provide them to the root level that is index.js

Movies
- created a movie slice
- provide to the store 
- confirmed it by checking the redux store
 
  # custom hook
   - useNowPlayingMovies.js - created a custom hook for the movieSlice and called the function in browse page

# Bugfix
- redirection issues solved by placeing the onAuthStateChange in header.js file
- fixed the signout display, show's only when the user is logged in 

# TMDB
- first need to signup and provide the details to create a key and access token
- then go to the tmdb docs > api reference > movie list
- choose the language (JS) and copy the options to the constants 
- in browse fetch the movies using the fetch api 
- call the function inside the useEffect function
